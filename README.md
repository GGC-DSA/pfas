# PFAS
## Description
PFAS (Teflon, etc.) are found not only in pots and pans but also in the blood of people around the world, including 99 percent of Americans. PFAS chemicals pollute water, do not break down, and remain in the environment and people for decades. With that in mind we will be researching the water quality data. We will aiming to find simialrities in the water that had PFAS and those that did not. This will allow us to predict possible water systems that may need to get retested and treated for PFAS.
