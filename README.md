# PFAS
## PFAS in Ga 
## Description
PFAS (Teflon, etc.) are found not only in pots and pans but also in the blood of people around the world, including 99 percent of Americans. PFAS chemicals pollute water, do not break down, and remain in the environment and people for decades. With that in mind we will be researching the water quality data. We will aiming to find simialrities in the water that had PFAS and those that did not. This will allow us to predict possible water systems that may need to get retested and treated for PFAS.

## David's Hypothesis
The two working hypotheses I have so far are, So I was thinking to see the correlation between the number of violations and the number of sites visited within those counties? Another hypothesis can be, Does population affect the number of violations that occurred on site.

## Current Progress of David's Notebook
I added my datasets, and have tried and single out the things needed to test my hypothesis, I have so far singled out a few thigns from a data set that primarily focuses on
the company and where they tested the water, how many people were in that area, how many sites were in that area, and how many of those sites had violations 
on site. With this I was going to test our hypothesis.

## Andres' Hypothesis
For me, I have three hypotheses. The first one is see the correlation of the dumping of factory sites has a connection to pfas growth. Second is to see if there are chemicals from dumping that hints the future expose of pfas into the water. The last one is to see if there is a growth in people exposed to pfas in contaminated locations

## Current progress
Added all my datasets into the notebook. Have been focusing on of them and broke it down to the locations and dates of found chemicals in georgia for each year between 2013-2016. I have also broken down my other sets but am waiting to match up those with teh ucmr data. Soon or later I am hoping to line that up with David's dataset to see if we could find factory dumpings in the same counties for possible correlations.
